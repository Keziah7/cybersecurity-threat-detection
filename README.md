# cybersecurity-threat-detection
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting cybersecurity threats by analyzing network traffic data. The goal is to preprocess and visualize the data, then build a machine learning model to classify normal and malicious traffic.

ðŸ“‚ Dataset
The dataset consists of network traffic logs with various features such as protocols, connection states, and numerical metrics. The key steps taken so far include:

Loading the dataset and checking for missing values.

Converting categorical data into numerical form using Label Encoding.

Standardizing numerical data with StandardScaler.

Saving the processed dataset for further analysis.

ðŸ“Š Data Visualization
To understand the data better, I created the following visualizations:

Attack Type Distribution â†’ A bar chart showing the frequency of different attack types.

Feature Correlation Heatmap â†’ Displays relationships between numerical features.

âš¡ Next Steps
Implement feature selection to optimize the dataset.

Train and evaluate a machine learning model (e.g., Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Neural Networks).

Test the modelâ€™s performance on real or simulated network traffic data.
